  @article{Clark_2024, title={Taboos and Self-Censorship Among {U}.{S}. Psychology Professors}, ISSN={1745-6916}, DOI={10.1177/17456916241252085}, abstractNote={We identify points of conflict and consensus regarding (a) controversial empirical claims and (b) normative preferences for how controversial scholarship—and scholars—should be treated. In 2021, we conducted qualitative interviews (n = 41) to generate a quantitative survey (N = 470) of U.S. psychology professors’ beliefs and values. Professors strongly disagreed on the truth status of 10 candidate taboo conclusions: For each conclusion, some professors reported 100% certainty in its veracity and others 100% certainty in its falsehood. Professors more confident in the truth of the taboo conclusions reported more self-censorship, a pattern that could bias perceived scientific consensus regarding the inaccuracy of controversial conclusions. Almost all professors worried about social sanctions if they were to express their own empirical beliefs. Tenured professors reported as much self-censorship and as much fear of consequences as untenured professors, including fear of getting fired. Most professors opposed suppressing scholarship and punishing peers on the basis of moral concerns about research conclusions and reported contempt for peers who petition to retract papers on moral grounds. Younger, more left-leaning, and female faculty were generally more opposed to controversial scholarship. These results do not resolve empirical or normative disagreements among psychology professors, but they may provide an empirical context for their discussion.}, journal={Perspectives on Psychological Science}, publisher={SAGE Publications Inc}, author={Clark, Cory J. and Fjeldmark, Matias and Lu, Louise and Baumeister, Roy F. and Ceci, Stephen and Frey, Komi and Miller, Geoffrey and Reilly, Wilfred and Tice, Dianne and {von Hippel}, William and Williams, Wendy M. and Winegard, Bo M. and Tetlock, Philip E.}, year={2024}, month=may, pages={17456916241252085}, language={en} }

 @article{Proust-Lima_Philipps_Liquet_2017, title={Estimation of Extended Mixed Models Using Latent Classes and Latent Processes: The R Package lcmm}, volume={078}, url={https://ideas.repec.org//a/jss/jstsof/v078i02.html}, abstractNote={The R package lcmm provides a series of functions to estimate statistical models based on linear mixed model theory. It includes the estimation of mixed models and latent class mixed models for Gaussian longitudinal outcomes (hlme), curvilinear and ordinal univariate longitudinal outcomes (lcmm) and curvilinear multivariate outcomes (multlcmm), as well as joint latent class mixed models (Jointlcmm) for a (Gaussian or curvilinear) longitudinal outcome and a time-to-event outcome that can be possibly left-truncated right-censored and defined in a competing setting. Maximum likelihood esimators are obtained using a modified Marquardt algorithm with strict convergence criteria based on the parameters and likelihood stability, and on the negativity of the second derivatives. The package also provides various post-fit functions including goodness-of-fit analyses, classification, plots, predicted trajectories, individual dynamic prediction of the event and predictive accuracy assessment. This paper constitutes a companion paper to the package by introducing each family of models, the estimation technique, some implementation details and giving examples through a dataset on cognitive aging.}, number={i02}, journal={Journal of Statistical Software}, publisher={Foundation for Open Access Statistics}, author={Proust-Lima, Cécile and Philipps, Viviane and Liquet, Benoit}, year={2017}, language={en} }
